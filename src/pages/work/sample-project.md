# Sustainable Science Kit (Anonymized)

**Client Goal:** Launch an eco-friendly science kit for a subscription audience on a tight timeline.

**DaKong Solution:** Co-developed the kit with FSC-certified woods, swapped plastic trays for folded card inserts, and optimized kitting steps for speed.

**Outcome:** On-time launch; plastic content reduced by ~80%; packaging volume reduced by ~18% improving freight efficiency.

## Approach

- Concept refinement and BOM simplification
- Prototype iterations and safety pathfinding (ASTM F-963)
- Line setup for parallel kitting and packaging
