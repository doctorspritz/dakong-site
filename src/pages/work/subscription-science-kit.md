# Subscription Science Kit (Anonymized)

**Client Goal:** Launch a durable, eco-friendly science kit for ages 8â€“12 under tight timelines.

**DaKong Solution:** Re-engineered packaging with paper-based trays, simplified BOM, and parallelized kitting lines; validated compliance (ASTM F-963) ahead of scale.

**Outcome:** On-time launch; plastic content reduced by ~80%; packaging volume reduced by ~15%; defect rate under 0.5% during first two runs.

## Approach

- Concept/BOM refinement and early sample testing
- Packaging dielines; labeling and documentation
- Line setup and operator work instructions; in-process checks
